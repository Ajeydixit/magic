	Running MAGIC3.*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Steps for running MAGIC3

	1) Download the highest avialable version MAGIC3*.tar.gz
	2) Gunzip and un-tar, this will leave a directory MAGIC3*.
        3) Change magic.make by setting parameter FC=ifort to your 
	   prefered compiler (F90 required). Change compiler options 
           FFLAGS = ...  
	4) Adapt the numerical truncation for your problem in file
	   truncation.f or copy truncation_BM.f to truncation.f for
	   the BM2 test below. 
        5) Run make -f magic.make
	   This will produce the executable magic.exe.
        6) Download testBM.tar.gz, gunzip and un-tar.
	   This will create a directory BM2.
        7) Directory BM2 contains input-files, run-scripts, and 
	   restuls for Benchmark II tests. 
           BM2 is a run that starts with a small disturbance and 
           integrates until the solutions is quasi stationary. 
	   All output files from thus run have the tag *.BM2.
	   BM2a takes the restart file rst_end.BM2 and integrates 
           for 50 time steps. The solution is not changing further. 
	   Run BM2b and see whether the results are identical to
	   those of BM2a. Small changes (order 1e-5 or so) due to 
	   different computer precissions are OK. 
           The runs are setup to run on 8 cores. If you have fewer
	   cores available change nThreadsRun to the respective number.
