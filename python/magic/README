If you want to enable all the features of the python suboutines, libraries
have to be generated using f2py.
Depending on your fortran compiler, you have to modify genLib.py and then
execute it: ./genLib.py

with gfortran, you also need to set up an environement variable to ensure
that the program reads big endian binary files:

export GFORTRAN_CONVERT_UNIT=big_endian
